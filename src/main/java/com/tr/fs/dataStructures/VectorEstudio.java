/**
 * The Vector class implements a growable array of objects.
 * Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index.
 * However, the size of a Vector can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate adding and removing
 * items after the Vector has been created.
 *
 * In Java, the Vector and List implementations both represent ordered collections, but there are differences between the two:
 *
 * Synchronization:
 *
 * Vector: It is synchronized by default, meaning it's thread-safe. Every method in a Vector is synchronized, which can sometimes lead to slower performance in a multi-threaded environment due to the overhead of synchronization.
 * List (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList): These implementations (like ArrayList or LinkedList) are not synchronized by default. If thread safety is required, synchronization needs to be handled explicitly using Collections.synchronizedList() to wrap these non-thread-safe lists.
 * Performance:
 *
 * Vector: Due to its synchronized nature, performance might be slightly slower compared to non-synchronized counterparts, especially in scenarios where synchronization isnâ€™t necessary.
 * List (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList): These classes provide better performance in non-concurrent environments. ArrayList, for instance, is generally faster than Vector because it's not synchronized.
 * Growth rate:
 *
 * Vector: It doubles its array size by default when it needs to grow. This can be less memory-efficient when the collection grows.
 * List (e.g., ArrayList): It also grows its internal array, but by a larger factor (typically 1.5 times or a similar strategy). This can be more memory-efficient when compared to the doubling behavior of Vectors.
 * Legacy status:
 *
 * Vector: It's part of Java's older collections framework and is considered a legacy class.
 * List (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList): These are part of the newer Collections Framework and offer more flexibility and are commonly used.
 * Iterator behavior:
 *
 * Vector: Its iterators are designed to be fail-safe, which means they won't throw ConcurrentModificationException if the vector is modified while iterating.
 * List (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList): Iterators on ArrayList and LinkedList might throw ConcurrentModificationException if the list is structurally modified while being iterated without using the iterator's own methods for modification.
 * In general, unless there's a specific requirement for synchronization or compatibility with older code, using ArrayList or LinkedList (from the List interface) might be more preferable due to better performance and memory efficiency.
